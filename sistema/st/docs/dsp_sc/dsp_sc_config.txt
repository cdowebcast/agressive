1.0   Introduction
------------------

The aim of this document is to show you what needs to be entered in the different options
in the plug-ins configuration window to allow it to work with the sc_serv2 and sc_trans
configuration examples. The setups covered are:

    Connecting as a source to the server in SHOUTcast 2 and SHOUTcast 1 (legacy) modes
    Connecting as a DJ to a transcoder in SHOUTcast 2 and SHOUTcast 1 (legacy) modes



2.0   Configurations
--------------------

In all of the example configurations, it is assumed that Winamp has been chosen as the
input source for the stream(s) being created and that all of the passwords used are the
same as those in the sc_serv2 and sc_trans example configuration files. Remember that you
should change the example passwords when setting up your SHOUTcast system.

The choice of the encoder used is left as something for you to decide upon considering
the DSP plug-in supports MP3 and AAC along with all of the different bitrates, etc.
However this should not cause an issue with the example setups used but is something you
need to decide upon as part of the general process in setting up a SHOUTcast system.

Finally the name of the options as shown in the english translation of the plug-in on its
'Output' tab (see dsp_sc.txt - section 3.2) will be used in this file to identify the
options which need to be entered. This is mentioned incase a localised version of the DSP
plug-in is used (a nice feature implemented in version 2 of the plug-in).


2.1   Direct Source to a SHOUTcast v2 DNAS Server
-------------------------------------------------

Connection Tab
--------------

Server Address : localhost (or the IP of the server if it is different from the local
                 machine [see dsp_sc.txt - section 3.2.1 for more information] ).
Port : 8000 (or the value set for 'portbase' [see sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.8] ).
Stream ID : 1 (or the value set for 'streamid' for the relevant connection being made to
               the server [see sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.12] ).

DJ / User ID : this can be left blank and is not used with a source connection.
Password : testing (or the value set for 'password' [see sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.8] ).

Use SHOUTcast v1 mode (for legacy servers) : ensure this is UNCHECKED.

Directory Tab
--------------

Here you can enter any details as required to identify or provide contact details for
your stream to any clients connecting or when viewed on the SHOUTcast Directory listing.

Make this stream public (Recommended) : The usage of this setting depends upon the value
                                        of 'publicserver' in your server configuration.
                                        See sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.14 for details.


2.2   Direct Source to a SHOUTcast v1 DNAS Server (Legacy)
----------------------------------------------------------

Connection Tab
--------------

Server Address : localhost (or the IP of the server if it is different from the local
                 machine [see dsp_sc.txt - section 3.2.1 for more information] ).
Port : 8000 (or the value set for 'portbase' for the SHOUTcast v1 DNAS server used.

Password : testing (or the value set for 'password' for the SHOUTcast v1 server used).

Use SHOUTcast v1 mode (for legacy servers) : ensure this is CHECKED.

Directory Tab
-------------

Here you can enter any details as required to identify or provide contact details for
your stream to any clients connecting or when viewed on the SHOUTcast Directory listing.


2.3   DJ Source to the Transcoder in SHOUTcast v2 Mode
------------------------------------------------------

Connection Tab
--------------

Server Address : localhost (or the IP of the server if it is different from the local
                 machine [see dsp_sc.txt - section 3.2.1 for more information] ).
Port : 8505 (or the value set for 'djport2' [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).
Stream ID : this can be left as the default value ('1') as the Transcoder effectively
            ignores this for this connection though may be used in future versions.

DJ / User ID : dj (or the value set for 'djlogin' for the respective DJ account setup in the
              sc_trans configuration [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).
Password : noise (or the value set for 'djpassword' for the respective DJ account setup
                 in the sc_trans configuration [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).

Use SHOUTcast v1 mode (for legacy servers) : ensure this is UNCHECKED.

Directory Tab
-------------

Here you can enter any details as required to identify or provide contact details for
your stream to any clients connecting or when viewed on the SHOUTcast Directory listing.

Make this stream public (Recommended) : The usage of this setting depends upon the value
                                        of 'publicserver' in your server configuration.
                                        See sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.14 for details.


2.4   DJ Source to the Transcoder in SHOUTcast v1 Mode (Legacy)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Connection Tab
--------------

Server Address : localhost (or the IP of the server if it is different from the local machine
                     [see dsp_sc.txt - section 3.2.1 for more information] ).
Port : 8500 (or the value set for 'djport' [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).

DJ / User ID : dj (or the value set for 'djlogin' for the respective DJ account setup in
               the sc_trans configuration [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).
Password : noise (or the value set for 'djpassword' for the respective DJ account setup
                 in the sc_trans configuration [see sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3] ).

Use SHOUTcast v1 mode (for legacy servers) : ensure this is CHECKED.

Directory Tab
-------------

Here you can enter any details as required to identify or provide contact details for
your stream to any clients connecting or when viewed on the SHOUTcast Directory listing.

Make this stream public (Recommended) : The usage of this setting depends upon the value
                                        of 'publicserver' in your server configuration.
                                        See sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.14 for details.


3.0   SHOUTcast 2 Cipher Key
----------------------------

If you find that you do need to change the uvoxcipherkey (sc_serv2.txt - section 4.0.14)
or the djcipher (sc_trans.txt - section 3.0.3) in you sc_serv and / or sc_trans setups
then you can change the cipher key the DSP uses. You will only need to do this if you get
the following status message when making a connection:

    Authentication Error:
    Cipher Does Not Match

This is done currently via editing 'Cipherkey' entry in dsp_sc.ini in your Winamp config
folder where you just need to change the string after the equal sign to the value from
'uvoxcipherkey' or 'djcipher' depending upon what you are trying to connect to.

The dsp_sc.ini file can usually be found by entering %appdata%\Winamp\plugins into the
address bar in Windows Explorer. If it is not there then you should search for dsp_sc.ini
and make sure to have the search program you are using to look for hidden files (this is
just incase the OS is hiding the settings folder).
